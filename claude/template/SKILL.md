Every skill needs a SKILL.md file with two parts: YAML frontmatter (between --- markers) that tells Claude when to use the skill, and markdown content with instructions Claude follows when the skill is invoked. The name field becomes the /slash-command, and the description helps Claude decide when to load it automatically.

name: explain-code
description: Explains code with visual diagrams and analogies. Use when explaining how code works, teaching about a codebase, or when the user asks "how does this work?"
---

## Steps
1. **Start with an analogy**: Compare the code to something from everyday life
2. **Draw a diagram**: Use ASCII art to show the flow, structure, or relationships
3. **Walk through the code**: Explain step-by-step what happens
4. **Highlight a gotcha**: What's a common mistake or misconception?

## Tips
- Keep explanations conversational. For complex concepts, use multiple analogies.
